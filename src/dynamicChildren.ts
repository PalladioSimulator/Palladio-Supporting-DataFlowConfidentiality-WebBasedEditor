// This file contains helpers to dynamically specify the children of a sprotty element.
// Element children are generally used for e.g. labels in sprotty or other sub elements.
// You could embed everything into one element but it is often easier to use children.
// E.g. for editable labels you would need to implement a custom label edit ui which is pretty complicated.

// Normally, the children of a sprotty element are specified in the model.
// However this means that the children are saved together with the model.
// Imagine you want to change the children of a node at some point, e.g to add another text label,
// move it slightly or align the text differently.
// When you save the children you would need to migrate the previously saved models
// to the new children.

// This is undesirable as the display of a node should not be hardcoded in the serialized model.
// To circumvent this, these helper classes were developed.
// The model is saved without children and the children are added dynamically by the runtime
// by each model element using the setChildren method.
// This sets the `children` array of the element and also loads data from the parent element into the children
// (e.g. texts for labels).
// When the model is saved, the removeChildren method is called to remove the children again.
// This method also needs to save the data of the children in the parent element, so it is properly saved.
// This ensures that the display of a node is a implementation detail and not encoded in the saved models.

// Abstract classes that define the both abstract methods setChildren and removeChildren
